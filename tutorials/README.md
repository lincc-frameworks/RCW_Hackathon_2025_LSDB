## [Notebook 1](Notebook_1.ipynb)

In this notebook, we will learn how to:

- Import DASK client
- Load object and source catalogs (lazily)
- Show HATS partitioning with ZTF objects and source
- Perform crossmatching with existing `LSDB` catalogs
- Save the results of a science workflow to disk

## [Notebook 2](Notebook_2.ipynb)

In this notebook, we will learn:

- How to access photo-z catalog derived from Rubinâ€™s Data Preview 1 with LSDB 

## [Notebook 3](Notebook_3.ipynb)

In this notebook, we will learn:

- What nested pandas is
- How to do basic operations on timeseries

## [Notebook 4](Notebook_4.ipynb)

In this notebook, we will learn how to:

- Crossmatch custom list of positions
- Access Object and diaObject data from Rubin DP1
- Show lightcurves for both Objects and diaObjects

## [Notebook 5](Notebook_5.ipynb)

In this notebook, we provide several AGN-related problems:

- Crossmatch SDSS AGNs with Rubin DP1 photo-z catalog
- Crossmatch a large catalog of AGN with Rubin DP1 data
- Run scientific analysis on lightcurves from Rubin DP1
